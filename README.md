# push_swap
Project in the algorithm and AI branch in Hive Helsinki: create an algorithm to sort a stack

The algorithm has to use a set of specific instructions and another stack to sort the given integers in ascending order.
The checker program reads these instructions from standard input and executes them on the stack/stacks and lastly checks if the first stack is sorted and the second stack is empty.
The push_swap program prints instructions which will sort the first stack and leave the second one empty. This program's output should be piped to the checker program.
